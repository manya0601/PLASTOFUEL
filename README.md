💻 **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/manya0601/TECHDES](https://github.com/manya0601/TECHDES)  
📒 **Colab Model Notebook:** [waste_classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/manya0601/TECHDES/blob/main/waste_classifier.ipynb)



## 🏁 Project Overview  

**TECHDES** (short for *Tech + Design for Waste Education and Segregation*) is an **AI-powered educational platform** that teaches people how to segregate waste correctly while showcasing how technology and smart systems can make waste management more efficient.

The system integrates:
- 🧠 A **machine learning model** that classifies waste items using CNN.
- ♻️ A **web-based simulator** that visualizes waste sorting.
- 📚 An **educational interface** that teaches users about types of waste, segregation rules, and recycling policies.



## 🎯 Objective  

To **educate and empower users**—especially students and citizens—about proper waste segregation through **interactive learning, AI-based classification, and real-world simulations**.

The project supports the goals of *Swachh Bharat Mission* and *UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 & 12)* for sustainable cities and responsible consumption.



## 🧩 Key Features  

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **AI-Based Waste Classification** | CNN model classifies waste into categories like plastic, paper, glass, metal, and organic. |
| 📱 **Web App Interface** | User-friendly educational platform with multiple learning modules. |
| 🎮 **Simulation Zone** | Demonstrates how smart waste segregation happens inside automated bins. |
| 🏙️ **City Rules Section** | Provides city-wise waste segregation guidelines in India. |
| 🧩 **Quiz & Learn Modules** | Engaging lessons and quizzes for schools and students to understand waste management. |
| 🌐 **UN & India Policy Section** | Explains how Indian waste policies align with UN Sustainable Goals. |
| 💡 **Tips & Awareness** | Offers everyday eco-friendly waste practices. |
| 🛍️ **Upcycled Marketplace** | Promotes circular economy by displaying creative products made from recycled waste. |



## 🧠 Machine Learning Model  

The waste classifier model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
It processes images of waste materials and classifies them into predefined categories.
